# Algorithms
A collection of programs that pertain to algorithms including: 

* Dijkstra's algorithm: An implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs
*  Binary Search Tree/BST Operations: A full implementation of a binary search tree, as well as tree traversals and a method to get the height of a tree
*  Balance/Day-Stout-Warren algorithm: An implementation of the Day-Stout-Warren algorithm which is an in-place algorithm that balances binary search trees
